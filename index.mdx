## Key Concepts

- **Node:** Permissioned database for storing supply or demand data.
- **Connections:** Links between your company nodes and those of your vendors or customers.
- **Lists:** Uploaded files or mirrored tables containing standardized supply or demand data.
- **Listing:** A single supply or demand line item within a list.
- **Network Feed:** Real-time feed of listings from your connections.
- **Quote:** An offer sent for a specific listing or group of listings.
- **Quote Response:** A reply to a quoteâ€”accepting, rejecting, or countering the offer.
- **Order:** Final agreement where both parties accept a quote and confirm the transaction details.
